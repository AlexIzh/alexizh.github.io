    <p>Hi!<br />
My name is <strong>Alex</strong>, I’m an <code>iOS</code> and <code>macOS</code> developer with a quite big experience.</p>

<p>My favorite book (about programming) is <code>Working effectively with legacy code</code>. I like it because it contains very interesting things how you could work with a bad structured/untested/old code, and as we all know, it is most code. But at the same time, all we (or almost all) want to provide good services to our customers and make them happy (or at least a bit happier).</p>

<h4>How I became a developer?</h4>
<p>Here is my journey from a moment when I started to learn programming to these days: <br /><br /></p>

<p>I started to learn programming at school when  I was around 13-14 years old.<br />
It was Pascal programming language. I liked it a lot, so I started to look at other more popular languages.<br />
Then I started to learn <code>C</code>. Can’t say it was a successful try, it was quite difficult for me in those days.<br />
Later I started to look for any easier language to learn and a lot of articles on the internet said that I should try to learn <code>Python</code>. And of course, I started to learn it. It was more successful try than with <code>C</code>, but still, I didn’t write any complete application (even small) with that just because I didn’t find how to write UI with <code>Python</code>.
After that, I came back to C and started to learn <code>C++</code> with using <code>C++ Builder</code> for Windows. It’s the first time I implemented a small real application with UI.<br />
That’s how my way was started.</p>

<p>After that, I implemented/tried a lot of languages and platforms. I even tried and learned Perl a bit and wrote a small chat-bot on it! But don’t ask me to repeat it, it was years ago and since then I even didn’t see Perl anymore.<br />
Some other examples what I did for fun/learning purposes (what is not related to my job/iOS/macOS development):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>C/GTK+</code> on Linux - a few small UI applications, tic-tac-toe, sea battle</li>
  <li>A small unfinished game on <code>C#</code> for <code>Bada</code>(old Samsung mobile OS) (by the way, I tried <code>C#</code> with <code>Unity</code> last couple of years)</li>
  <li>Parsing a math expression from a string and draw a graph of the function on <code>Delphi</code></li>
  <li>Simulation of people evacuation in case of fire - <code>Java</code> (very interesting project)
<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<p>And in 2011 one outsourcing company hired me as a junior and I started to learn iOS development. Since that I also learned and tried a lot, a lot of projects passed away, a lot of time was spent on development and after all this time, I still love it and like to learn new things and try to develop something even in my free time (of course, when I have it after my family).</p>

<p>You can look at some (not all) my projects <a href="/portfolio/index.html">here</a>.<br />
Also you can find my blog (it doesn’t have so many interesting articles but anyway) in the <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a>.<br />
<a href="/gh-activity/index.html">GitHub Projects</a> page contains list of my open-source projects.<br />
And, of course, you always can find my CV file <a href="/images/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, you always can write me a message through the channels provided below.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to hearing about you!<br />
Best regards, <br />
<strong>Alex</strong>.</p>
